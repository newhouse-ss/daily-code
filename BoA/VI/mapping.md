### M1

M1 – API 学习 & 技术解释（Fast learning / Tech skill / Explain complex info）

> One example is when I had to build an API for a handwritten-character classification model with almost no prior backend experience.
>
> At first I didn’t even know how to connect the model to a service. So I broke it down into small steps: I reviewed REST basics, read official documentation, and followed a small tutorial. Then I wrote a clear README and sample requests so that my teammates could easily understand how to use the service. I iterated by testing edge cases and monitoring errors.
>
> Within a few days we had a stable API with about 0.91 prediction accuracy that my teammates could call reliably. This experience shows how I keep up with new technology, learn independently outside the classroom, and then explain technical concepts clearly to others.

### M2

M2 – Kaggle 团队合作 & 成就（Teamwork / Conflict / Persuasion / Initiative / Complex problem）

Another **key experience** was a recent **Kaggle competition**, where our small team worked on a **predictive modeling task**. Suddenly, one teammate became **unresponsive**, so the remaining two of us had to **cover everything** under time pressure.

I proposed that we **reorganize** our roles: I focused on **data cleaning**, **feature engineering**, and building strong **baseline models**, while my teammate focused on model tuning and ensembling. When we had different opinions about which **approach** to take, I relied on small **experiments** and clear **data** rather than opinions to **persuade** the team. I also set up a shared repository and experiment log so communication stayed concrete and transparent.

In the end, we finished around 112 out of more than 1,100 teams. This showed me how **proactive communication**, **clear ownership**, and evidence-based persuasion can turn a stressful situation into a solid team result.

### M3

自我介绍 & 动机 & 强项（Intro / Why BoA / Why this role）

> My name is Hengyu Zhou, and I’m currently a master’s student in Bioinformatics at the University of Tokyo. My background combines computer science, data analysis, and hands-on software development.
>
> For example, I deployed a handwritten-character classification model as an API service, and I also worked on a Kaggle competition where our two-person team ranked around 112 out of more than 1,100 teams. These projects strengthened my structured problem-solving skills and my ability to collaborate under pressure.
>
> I’m interested in Bank of America because it’s a global institution where technology directly supports markets, risk management, and clients. I’d like to grow in an environment where I can keep learning, build robustTell us about a complex analytical or problem-solving situation you handled. technical solutions, and see a clear connection between my code and real business impact.

### M4

M4 – 多任务 & 困难决策（Limited info / Multi-task / Quick decision）

> Recently I had to handle several high-pressure tasks at the same time: coursework deadlines, a project milestone, and interview preparation. It wasn’t clear how long each would take, but all were important.
>
> I started by listing all deadlines and the minimum acceptable outcome for each. Then I estimated the time needed, prioritized based on urgency and impact, and created a simple schedule with focused blocks for each task. During execution I protected those time blocks, avoided context-switching, and accepted that some tasks only needed to be “good enough” instead of perfect.
>
> In the end I met all key deadlines without burning out. This experience taught me that when information and time are limited, explicitly structuring the problem and making transparent trade-offs is more effective than trying to do everything at once.

### M5

M5 – 诚信 & 数据准确性（Integrity）

通用 60 秒答案

> If I found that some underlying numbers in a critical report might be wrong just before the deadline, my priority would be accuracy and transparency.
>
> First I would quickly double-check the data source and quantify how serious the issue is. If there is a real error, I would immediately inform my manager, explain the impact, and propose options—for example, submitting a corrected version slightly later, or submitting on time but clearly flagging which figures are under review and should not be used for decisions.
>
> Personally I would recommend the option that avoids misleading stakeholders, even if it means adjusting the original timeline. In a financial context, maintaining data integrity and trust is more important than strictly meeting the initial deadline.

### M6

M6 – 科技趋势 & 市场影响（Current event / Market impact / Role）

> One major current trend is the rapid adoption of AI and digital technologies in financial services, especially data-driven and generative AI tools.
>
> On the positive side, this improves efficiency, risk analysis, and client experience—for example, faster analytics, better personalization, and smoother digital channels. At the same time it raises challenges, such as model risk, data privacy, and the need for strong governance.
>
> For a bank like Bank of America, this trend means technology is not just internal infrastructure; it directly shapes products, markets, and how clients interact with the firm. For someone in a technical role, it reinforces the need to continuously learn new tools while also thinking carefully about robustness, transparency, and regulatory expectations.
